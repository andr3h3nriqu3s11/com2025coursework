# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# The following keys must be escaped otherwise they will not be retrieved by
# the default I18n backend:
#
# true, false, on, off, yes, no
#
# Instead, surround them with single quotes.
#
# en:
#   'true': 'foo'
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

            Wallets represent an area of you finances!<br>
            Your <b><i>Expenses</i></b> wallet represents you expenses and you <b><i>Net Worth</i></b> wallet represents you net worth.<br>
            Wallets can have negative values since they can also represent external parts of you finances where some else is losing the value.<br>
            Your <b><i>Incomings</i></b> wallet will have negative value since it represents the money you receive form your work or somebody.<br>

            Transactions represent movements of your assets.<br>
            A transaction form the <i>Net Worth</i> wallet to the <i>Expenses</i> wallet with the value of 10 means that 10 the currency you consider to be holding on the <i>Net worth</i> wallet is going to the <i>Expenses</i> wallet.<br>
            The sentence above referred to \"currency\" instead of pounds or dollars as of now the system does not the care if you are storing dollars, pounds or potatoes, it will treat every as the same \"unit\"!<br>
